# SOFAI Tool

SOFAI Tool is a neurosymbolic system designed to integrate fast heuristic-based decision-making (System 1) with logical, deliberative processing (System 2) through a metacognition module. This package enables developers and researchers to easily instantiate, configure, and extend System 1 and System 2 solvers, log system activities, and visualize solver performance across a batch of problems.

## Features

- **Flexible Solver Architecture**: Define custom System 1 and System 2 solvers with confidence estimation and problem-solving methods.
- **Metacognitive Governance**: A metacognition module that chooses between System 1 and System 2 based on confidence levels.
- **Logging and Visualization**: Log solutions, confidence levels, and visualize the activities of System 1 and System 2 across multiple problems.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/sofai_tool.git
